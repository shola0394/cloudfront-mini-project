Scenario: A company wants to host a public website with static content, such as images, videos, and HTML files. The website should be accessible to anyone on the internet, and the content should be distributed globally for faster access. The company has already registered a domain name, and wants to use it for the website.
In this scenario, CloudFront can be used as a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute the website's static content across multiple geographic locations, providing faster access to the content for users worldwide. S3 bucket can be used to store the website's static content. Route 53 can be used as a domain name system (DNS) to route the website's traffic to the nearest CloudFront edge location.
